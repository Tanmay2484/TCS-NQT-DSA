Q1. (Basic Question) 
You have already given weights those are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000.  Here user given an Input a Weight. 
Where you have to find how many weights are required for full filling the user's given input from the given weights.

Example #1
Input: 12
Output: 2

Example #2
Input: 93
Output: 5
